## Overview  

This document describes the Shapes data tables that exist so far, sketches some schema that don't yet exist, and describes the workflow for populating and using the data.

The model is organized into two separate databases. In general, `shapes.sqlite` contains the data required by user-facing Shapes applications, and `shapes_experiments.sqlite` contains the data generated by those applications. Some data in `shapes.sqlite` is informed by analyzing data in `shapes_experiments.sqlite`.

## Shapes Application Data
This is the data required by user-facing Shapes applications.


### Source Data  
The `source` model describes the source (e.g. a chart, playlist, article, etc.) from which songs were added to the database.

source ||
--- | --- |
`id` | `integer`<br> The `id` for the source. |
`parent_entity` | `text`<br> The organization, publication, institution, etc. from which the source originated. |
`parent_stream` | `text`<br> The recurring series, feed, channel, etc. where the source was published. |
`instance_name` | `text`<br> The published instance of the source. |
`publication_date` | `numeric`<br> The publication date displayed on the source (this is not necessarily the actual release date). |
`location` | `text`<br> The URL of the source instance at the time it was added to the database. |

```sql
--Schema

CREATE TABLE source (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
  parent_entity TEXT,
  parent_stream TEXT,
  instance_name TEXT,
  publication_date NUMERIC, --DATETIME
  location TEXT

multisong_vid ||
--- | --- |
`id` | `integer`<br> The unique `id` for the valid match. |

`has_video` | `text`<br> Indicates whether the `video_id` has a decent quality music video ("Y"), or a static image ("N"), or is a temporary or lyric video, etc ("T"). |
`check_back` | `text`<br> Flags a video to check back later for a possible update to the `video_id` and `has_video`. For example, if a lyric video seems likely to be replaced soon by an official video. |
`shelf_life` | `text`<br> Indicates if the song is temporally bounded to a specific event, and not just to the stylistic qualities of its era. |
`start_time` | `numeric`<br> The time one second before the second when music begins (to trim non-music intros). This is input as displayed on YouTube, and converted to seconds in the player. |
`end_time` | `numeric`<br> The time one second after the second when the song ends (to trim non-music outros). This is input as displayed on YouTube, and converted to seconds in the player. |
`release_year` | `integer`<br> The year the song was first released, which may be different from the year it was published to YouTube. Can take a little research, especially for older songs. |

```sql
--Schema

CREATE TABLE video_metadata (

`video_height` | `integer`<br> The pixel height of active video content within the video file (inside letterboxing), or a pixel height that yields the correct aspect ratio relative to `video_width`. |
`x_offset` | `integer`<br> A pixel value based on `video_width` to correct active video content that is not centered on the x axis (uncommon).
`y_offset` | `integer`<br> A pixel value based on `video_height` to correct active video content that is not centered on the y axis (uncommon).

`session_id` | `integer`<br> A reference to the song session. |
`bass_notes` | `object`<br> Indicates chord-level bass note changes within the song. Each change defines:  <br>- the `timestamp` within the video when the change takes place, and <br>- the `bass_note` that corresponds to the `timestamp`. |
`shapes` | `object`<br> Indicates chord-level shape changes within the song, if different from key-level shapes. Each shape change defines:  <br>- the `timestamp` within the video when the change takes place, and <br>- the `shape` that corresponds to the `timestamp`. |
`root_notes` | `object`<br> Indicates chord-level root note changes within the song, if different from `bass_notes`. This introduces the idea of "function." Each change defines:  <br>- the `timestamp` within the video when the change takes place, and <br>- the `root_note` that corresponds to the `timestamp`. |

## API Workflow  


### Maintain a list of sources
Application: [`Song-Scraper`](https://github.com/davidforrest/Song-Scraper)

- Maintain the list within the application used for adding songs, currently, in the `README.md` file.

### Add Songs
Application: [`Song-Scraper`](https://github.com/davidforrest/Song-Scraper)

**Scrape from a recurring source**

- Work down the Recurring Sources list, one source at a time.
- For each source, open the chart link and scraper code, and follow steps in the code.
- In this process, songs are **checked for duplicates** before adding.
- The `video_id` is included in some scrapers, but not all.
- [Here's a video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iJciScKJulp1BurPt_GT1cboh_W1eSLO/view) of what this process looks like.

**Add a non-recurring source**

- TBD
- Duplicate songs still logged in `source-song`

**Add a single song**

- TBD


### Add YouTube Video IDs
Application: SQLite Studio

- Open the `playlisting` view in SQLite Studio.
- This displays metadata fields from multiple tables, sorted first by `check_back`, then by songs with no `video_id`.
- Copy-Paste `title` and `artist_name`, into a YouTube search
- Find the "official" or best quality video. Prioritize results that have music videos. It's sometimes helpful to sort by viewcount.
- Copy-Paste the video ID into the `video_id` field  
- Mark if `has_video`
- Optionally add any other metadata or notes.
- Commit changes in SQLite Studio

**Delete a song from the db**

- Sometimes while adding a video, you realize you don't actually want that song in the database.
- Delete the song's row from the `song` table. An `ON DELETE CASCADE` is set up on foreign keys that point to the `song` table, so rows in other tables that reference the deleted `song_id` will be deleted, too.

---

### Crawl YouTube Metadata

- regularly and automatically update YouTube data that's subject to change:
    - `yt_exists`
    - `yt_view_count`
    - `yt_regions_allowed`
    - `yt_regions_blocked`
- ok to overwrite prior values rather than tracking how this data changes over time? that seems a bit outside the focus of this project.


### Retrieve One-Time YouTube Metadata

- automatically populate the YouTube data that's unlikely to change:
    - `yt_age_restricted` (could this change?)
    - `yt_publication_date`
    - `duration`
    - `iframe_width`
    - `iframe_height`


### Download Music Video Files to the server

- only download songs that exist according to recent YouTube Metadata
- using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
- had been using a .txt file listing all `video_id` to be downloaded, with the following quality settings:  
```
youtube-dl -a song_list.txt -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4]/best' --id
```
- update `dl` field
- update `dl_width` and `dl_height` fields in Automatic Video Metadata
- check downloaded files against unique `video_id`s (to replace videos, for example, that were removed or blocked before we downloaded them)


### Input Manual Video Metadata

- the manual updates that aren't music-related:
    - `has_video`
    - `start_time`
    - `end_time`
    - `release_year`
- also includes video zoom until that can be automated
- as when adding `video_id`, optionally add any other metadata or notes. this is the sort of "music criticism" step--it needs some more definition and a place to live. 

### Play Videos as fullscreen background

- Filter videos for:
    - `video_id` is defined
    - available on YouTube in your region
    - `has_video`
    - published or added within a date range
    - etc.

Let's think about video zoom for a moment. What we're really doing is:
- laying a div over the video that matches the active content size  
- adjusting the video on the x & y axis beneath that div if necessary  
- scaling the div (and its contents) to fill the browser window (based on the shortest side?)


### Play a Browser Instrument over Video Background

- set default settings
- collect user settings to inform default settings (manually set tuning, instrument timbre, etc.)
- potentially use [websynths.com](https://websynths.com/) as inspiration?
- potentially make use of the default instrument and volume settings from the original iPad app?


### Automatically Analyze Tuning and Key Context

- Klaus [prototyped](https://gitlab.com/vltmrkls/shapes-detection) a shape detection that could (potentially) crawl over the downloaded video files.
- [tONaRT](http://www.zplane.de/index.php?page=description-tonart) and others can detect the tuning and Major/minor key, which a human could verify.
- ideally this kind of analysis would happen between music start and end times, or other time ranges defined elsewhere in the data
